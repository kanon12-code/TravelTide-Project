## Customer Segmentation Based on Travel Preferences

### Family-Oriented Travelers:
Characterized by longer stays and multiple rooms. Often book trips for family vacations.
**Assigned Perk:** Free Checked Bag (catering to family needs).

### High-Spending Travelers 
Tend to spend significantly on both flights and hotels.
**Assigned Perk:** Free Hotel Meal (adding value to their luxury experience).

### Budget Travelers: 
Actively look for discounts and prefer affordable bookings.
**Assigned Perk:** Exclusive Discounts (appealing to their cost-conscious nature).

### Frequent Travelers: 
Travel frequently with a low trip cancellation rate.
**Assigned Perk:** 1 Night Free Hotel with Flight (rewarding loyalty and encouraging repeat bookings).

### Spontaneous Travelers: 
Make bookings close to the departure date, with low cancellations.
**Assigned Perk:** No Cancellation Fees (encouraging risk-free bookings for last-minute planners).

### Moderate Travelers: 
Moderate Travelers typically book more than three trips annually.
These travelers often balance personal and work trips and are likely to seek convenience during their journeys.

This perk especially appeals to those seeking comfort and time-saving advantages without needing luxury benefits.
